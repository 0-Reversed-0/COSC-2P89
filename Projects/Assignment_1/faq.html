            <h2>Is Arhum Khan the best student at Brock?</h2>
            <p>Of course he is! He is super smart and should probably get a 100% on this assignment for being so
                amazing! He was the founder of this totally real company which was made out of his love for headphones.

        <div id="Question-2">
            <h2>What is the difference between open-back and closed-back headphones?</h2>
            <p>Open-back headphones have ear cups that let air and sound pass through, creating a more natural and
                spacious sound — perfect for home listening or studio work. Closed-back headphones, on the other hand,
                block out external noise and prevent sound from leaking, making them ideal for commuting, travel, or use
                in noisy environments.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Question-3">
            <h2>Do your headphones come with a warranty?</h2>
            <p>Yes! All our headphones come with a 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects. If you
                experience any issues with materials or workmanship during this period, simply contact our support team
                with your proof of purchase, and we will be happy to assist with repair or replacement.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Question-4">
            <h2>Can I try the headphones before buying?</h2>
            <p>If you visit our in-store location, you can test any display model before purchasing. Online orders are
                covered by our 30-day return guarantee. We understand how important it is to listen and test to a
                headphone before purchasing one. We guarantee customer satisfaction!</p>
